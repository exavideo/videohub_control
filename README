videohub_control: Configure your Videohub router via browser

This was developed for RPI TV's HD production setup and is currently
lacking some features that would be useful in a public-facing environment.
(Authentication is the big one.)

The $inputs and $outputs arrays set the labels. The Router.new(...) line
controls the Videohub that the server will connect to.
